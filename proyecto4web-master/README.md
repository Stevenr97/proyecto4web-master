Within this project there is a login where people can login, in case they are not registered there is a button that will take a page to do so. When a new person registers the data they are saved inside the Heroku database. In the event that the user registers a previously registered user, the error page will appear, in which he will be able to login again.

Once you login, you can search for the book you want to rate it and give an opinion, to search it can be done by name, isbn, author or year. The books were imported using import.py that uses the .csv file given for this project.
